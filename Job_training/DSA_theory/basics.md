## Big Oh Notation

Run Time complexity

Order of fastest to slowest
O(1) >> O(n) >> O(logn) >> O(nLogn) >> O(n^2) >> O(n ^3) >> O(2^n)

Constant >> Linear >> logarithmic >> nlogn >> quadratic >> cubic >> exponential

Operation doesnt depend on the input size >> proportional to the size of the
input >> algorithms that break the problem to smaller chunks per each invocation
: eg searching a binary search tree >> quick sort (same as above but also after
stitches the results back together) >> bubble sort

## Object Oriented Concepts

1. Inheritance
    - Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and
    attributes from another class.
2. Encapsulation
    - Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts in OOP. It
    describes the idea of restricting access to methods and attributes in a class.
3. Polymorphism
    - Polymorphism is another fundamental concept in OOP, which
    means multiple forms.
    - Polymorphism allows us to use a single interface with
    different underlying forms such as data types or classes
