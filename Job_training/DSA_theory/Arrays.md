# Array Algorithms

## Slow and faster pointer concept - 2 pointer Algorithm

- The first pointer `fast` : iterates across the entire array list
- The second pointer `slow` : iterates ideally only when there is a match in the
  content we are looking for. The slow pointer jumps to the index of the fast
  pointer to where there is a match
