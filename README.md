# README

Support the learning and development of Embedded Software roles by providing
reference behaviour questions that have been asked in the past or a revision of
notes to prepare for technical rounds.

Technical rounds questions support questions in Embedded C, Embedded C++ and
Python questions in case the need to branch out to other fields in the future.
