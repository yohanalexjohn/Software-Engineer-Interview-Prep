# Big Oh Notation
Run Time complexity

Order of fastest to slowest 
O(1) >> O(n) >> O(logn) >> O(nLogn) >> O(n^2) >> O(n ^3) >> O(2^n)

Constant >> Linear >> logarithmic >> nlogn >> quadratic >> cubic >> exponential

Operation doesnt depend on the input size >> proportional to the size of the input >> algorithms that break the problem to smaller chunks per each invocation : eg searching a binary search tree >> quick sort (same as above but also after stitches the results back together) >> bubble sort
