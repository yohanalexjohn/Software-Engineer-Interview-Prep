**Tell us about yourself**

I'm Nathan, I was most recently an Electronics/Embedded Software Engineer at Dyson, where I worked on Power electronics schematics and control algorithms for embedded software. I graduated from the University of Southampton with a Master's in Electrical and Electronic Engineering in 2023. In light of the recent layoffs at Dyson, I'm looking for a new role in a company where I can contribute everything I've learned from my prior experiences as well as learn and grow to be a highly skilled embedded software engineer

**Why Team One**

I believe it was mentioned that working in an SME would challenge me to take bigger roles in projects, and thus I'd be able to learn more. Furthermore it looks like the company makes some cutting edge high performance products which should provide a great challenge for me to be able to contribute to and produce.

**What do you know about Team One**

Team one specializes in electronics and information technology services such as 5G  modems/routers, with some focus on military sub-systems. The company offers a comprehensive range of technical services , including feasibility studies, circuit design, prototyping, software and firmware development, and system integration. 

Some projects include iLight, which is an IoT device for street lights what uses ZigBee communication to facilitate real-time environmental data processing to optimise energy use for street lights. 

Another project is the IoT trash bin sensor which are equipped with sensors to monitor fill levels, smell, and weight that form a mesh network that sends data to a control center to improve waste collection efficiency and planning. 

There's also the IoT Smart magazine that acts as a training simulator that mimics the sound of live rounds without using actual ammunition to be fit into rifles. Uses ZigBee, NFC, and Bluetooth for data exchange, enhancing traning safety and realism

**What are your strengths/weaknesses**

Strength that has been highlighted to me in my previous workplaces would definitely be that I am an independent quick learner. I am usually able to complete tasks with minimal guidance to a high quality on time. I would also say I have very strong organizational skills/project management skills. I am very meticulous when it comes to documenting all my work, e.g. I have personal notes on Obsidian, OneNote, and it makes it easy for me to transfer all my work into formal documentation on Confluence/JIRA and for presentations. Also avoids the issue of me explaining stuff to people. When it comes to code I usually document it very heavily and effectively, I use Doxygen to very quickly create documentation for the code I'm writing.

One weakness I would say I have ties in to my main strength. Like I said i'm pretty independent when it comes to my work, and sometimes it's detrimental. I have a tendency to not ask for help and instead bang my head against the wall until I come up with a solution. Sometimes it leads to a bit of time wasted. Another weakness I would say specifically for this role is that I don't really have work experience outside of uni with like, the entire software/firmware for a product, only handling a portion of it having been in a big company

**Experience with comms**

Zigbee is based on ieee 802.11.4, have dabbled with that standard with Matter for uni project, didn't really know how to get it to work so used OpenThread instead
