## Behavioral Questions

**Tell us about yourself**

I'm Nathan, I was most recently an Electronics/Embedded Software Engineer at Dyson, where I worked on Power electronics schematics and control algorithms for embedded software. I graduated from the University of Southampton with a Master's in Electrical and Electronic Engineering in 2023. Learned Python and Verilog from uni and internships (didn't use them in Dyson). In light of the recent layoffs at Dyson, I'm looking for a new role in a company where I can contribute everything I've learned from my prior experiences as well as learn and grow to be a highly skilled software engineer

**Why Oxford Ionics**

Want to work with cutting edge tech, learn about quantum computing (only briefly touched on it in A levels and uni). Heard of Oxford Ionics in the news before from some world records for highest performance quantum logic gates, longest qubit memory coherence time, fastest and highest performance quantum network.

For this role specifically, I'd love the chance to work across different disciplines (work with quantum science, photonics, electronics, software)

**What do you know about Oxford Ionics**

A pioneering company in the quantum computing field, founded by researchers from the University of Oxford. The company focuses on developing high-performance quantum computers by using electronics and combining photonic and microwave technology to achieve high levels of precision and scalability.

Oxford Ionics leverages trapped ion qubits, known for superior performance and low error rates and combines them with a unique electronic qubit control technology, allowing for more scalability of quantum computing systems.

**What are your strengths/weaknesses**

Strength that has been highlighted to me in my previous workplaces would definitely be that I am an independent quick learner. I am usually able to complete tasks with minimal guidance to a high quality on time. I would also say I have very strong organizational skills/project management skills. I am very meticulous when it comes to documenting all my work, e.g. I have personal notes on Obsidian, OneNote, and it makes it easy for me to transfer all my work into formal documentation on Confluence/JIRA and for presentations. Also avoids the issue of me explaining stuff to people. When it comes to code I usually document it very heavily and effectively, I use Doxygen to very quickly create documentation for the code I'm writing.

One weakness I would say I have ties in to my main strength. Like I said i'm pretty independent when it comes to my work, and sometimes it's detrimental. I have a tendency to not ask for help and instead bang my head against the wall until I come up with a solution. Sometimes it leads to a bit of time wasted. Another weakness I would say specifically for this role is that I don't really have work experience outside of uni with like, the entire software/firmware for a product, only handling a portion of it having been in a big company
