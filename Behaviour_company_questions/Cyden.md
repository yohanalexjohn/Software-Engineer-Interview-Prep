# Why Cyden

## IPL : Intense Pulse Light 

I am excited about the opportunity to join Cyden in Swansea because I am
passionate about working with a company that is at the **forefront of
innovation in the beauty and healthcare technology sector**. Cyden’s reputation
for high-quality products and industry leadership is impressive, and I am eager
to contribute to a company that makes a significant positive i**mpact on
people’s lives.**

I am aware that the company was founded by 4 people of varying skillset , a
professor, a scientist, an engineer and a businessman. It shows how a
collaborative group can achieve great things together irrespective of their
background. 

Professionally, I am looking for a role that offers continuous learning and
growth, and I believe Cyden’s commitment to excellence and its collaborative
work environment will provide just that. Furthermore, Swansea’s vibrant
community and beautiful surroundings make it an ideal place for me to live and
work, ensuring a great balance between professional and personal life.

Ultimately, I am drawn to Cyden’s mission and values, which align closely with
my own. I am enthusiastic about the possibility of contributing to a team that
is dedicated to delivering innovative and effective beauty solutions to
consumers worldwide.
